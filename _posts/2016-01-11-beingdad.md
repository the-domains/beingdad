I became a Dad in September of 2014\. While I have been told what fatherhood would be like, I never understood until the last year.

Imagine a rollercoaster ride, coupled with the trip to the moon and back, then it might give you a small idea of what it is like.

This is what this blog will be dedicated to. Every time that fatherhood gets crazy and mad and loving and caring and frustrating and poop-cleaning and what not, I shall be delving in here to deliver a first hand account of what to expect.

Till then, take care.
