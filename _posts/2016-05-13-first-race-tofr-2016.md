![TeamBDC finally came to Thailand for our first road stage race. And nothing went as it should. This is a 5 part story about these 5 stages of pain and fun](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e2de4abe-afa8-40b4-b0b6-ac845b84ee8a.jpg)

In an ambulance? Seriously?

The day before I participate in my first racing event, that too in Thailand, the last thing that I expected was to ride an ambulance to a hospital to get myself checked. 

Dhrubo, our very own mad kid, was already over the brink. He had put two spoons of salt in his morning cereal and then finished it. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/23c0414d-18c3-42d7-a855-b67a1c3a234f.jpg)

Tanvir, had also made it onto the plane, at one point which seemed impossible. His visa and ticket came through Thursday afternoon and his flight was on Friday morning. 

Back in the hospital, the doctor, who thankfully knew a bit of English, told me that I had a viral fever along with a minor ear infection. I would later find out that night that my son, Nameer, had caught the same bug and had to be in a hospital as well. The helpful English speaking guide-lady got me my meds, and put me back on the ambulance. 

The fever abated at last that night. Tanvir had arrived, we said hi to Paddy the Pedal, after an early dinner, it was time to call it a day.
